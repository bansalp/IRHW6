How to compile?

Execute the following commands in order:
1. cd SentimentAnalysis/ [This command is used to set present working directory to SentimentAnalysis folder]
2. ant clean [This command is used to clean previously generated .class files]
3. ant build [This command is used to compile and generate .class files for the project]
4. chmod +x nbtrain [This command is used to give executable permissions to nbtrain file]
5. chmod +x nbtest [This command is used to give executable permissions to nbtest file]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to run?

Execute the following command:
Train classifier:
./nbtrain <training-directory> <model-file>

Predict the class of unseen test documents:
./nbtest <model-file> <test-directory> <predictions-file>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example:

Execute the following commands in order:

1. cd SentimentAnalysis/
2. ant clean
3. ant build
4. chmod +x nbtrain
5. chmod +x nbtest
6. Train classifier: ./nbtrain textcat/train model_file.txt
7. Predict the class of unseen dev documents: ./nbtest model_file.txt textcat/dev q2_predictions_file.txt
8. Predict the class of unseen test documents: ./nbtest model_file.txt textcat/test q3_predictions_file.txt

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Output:

output folder contains all the deliverables for the assignment. 
q2_predictions_file.txt contains predictions for the development data, which lists each filename in the dev directory, and the scores our model assigns to the possibilities of positive and negative reviews. 
q3_predictions_file.txt contains predictions for the test data, which lists each filename in the test directory, and the scores our model assigns to the possibilities of positive and negative reviews. 

Percentage of positive and negative reviews in the development data that were correctly classified:
Positive: 42.0%
Negative: 45.0%
